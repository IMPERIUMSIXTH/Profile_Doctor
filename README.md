## 🧠 Problem Statement

Chrome’s profile sync often breaks due to:
- Corrupted `Bookmarks`, `Preferences`, or `SyncData` files  
- Authentication mismatches between multiple devices  
- Unsynchronized or outdated local data  

Manual repair is complex, and data loss risk is high.  
**Profile Doctor** automates diagnosis and repair while maintaining transparency and backup integrity.
